Start by downloading the mySQL installer from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/. The current version should be 8.0.19.

Run the installer. You may be prompted to apply an option mySQL installer upgrade, I'm not sure if this matters much. I chose to install the updgrade.

On 'Choosing a Setup Type', select Developer Default. This should install everything you need to run mySQL locally, as well as MySQL workbench, which will make it easy to work on our database.

On 'Check requirements', click 'Execute' and run through the installation of all required programs before clicking 'Next'.

On 'Installation', click 'Execute' to install all products required for development. If any installations fail, click 'Retry'.

See how to start/stop running a MySQL server here: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/windows-start-command-line.html. If this doesn't work, MySQL server 8.0 might not be installed. In this case, run the installer again and install MySQL Servers -> MySQL Server -> MySQL Server 8.0.19

Once you complete the installation process, you should be able to open MySQL workbench and log into 'Local instance MySQL80'. Make sure to save the root password for the database - you will need this for django-mysql connection. On this instance, run the files in the sql directory in the following order: pothole-database.sql -> views.sql -> seed-data.sql.
