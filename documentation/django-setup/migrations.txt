This project doesn't use a majority of django's default tables, instead opting to use
unmanaged models that are created through sql files.

We do make use of the table django_session, which requires a migration.
In order to do this:

    SKIP the step 'python manage.py makemigrations'
        The default tables to migrate should already be present, and running makemigrations
        will raise the issue of dealing with other model migrations

    RUN 'python manage.py migrate'

    And then run the file 'sql/delete-unused-tables.sql' to remove all new tables except django_sessions
