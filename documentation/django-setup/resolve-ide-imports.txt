If you are on an IDE like PyCharm and are receiving import errors for modules within the project, then:

File > Settings > Project:pothole-reporting > Project Structure:
    Mark wheel_time_potholes, wheel_time_potholes/wheel_time_potholes, wheel_time_potholes/pothole_reporting
    as source folders

Even without the above change, you should still be able to run on command line,
but resolving the errors fixes autocompletion in the IDE.
