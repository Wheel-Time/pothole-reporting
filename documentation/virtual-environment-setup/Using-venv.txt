Make sure Python and pip are installed:
    python -V
    pip -V

Create a virtual environment using venv in the env folder (venv requires Python >= 3.3):
    python -m venv env

Activate the environment:
    Windows:
        env\Scripts\activate.bat

    Unix / MacOS:
        source env/bin/activate

You should now have (env) in front of your directory in the terminal

To install necessary project packages once the virtual environment is activated:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you've installed new dependencies via pip, then:
    pip freeze > requirements.txt

This will copy all package dependencies into requirements.txt, so they can be maintained
in version control and anyone running the program can install them with above commands.
