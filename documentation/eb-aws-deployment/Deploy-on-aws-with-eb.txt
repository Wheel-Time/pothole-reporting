Make sure to update your dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt

In your system's Users/YOU directory, create a folder named .aws
Inside, create a file named config
Add the following to config:

[profile eb-cli]
aws_access_key_id = KEY
aws_secret_access_key = SECRET_KEY

Where KEY and SECRET_KEY are the credentials for the IAM account associated with this project.

From there, you should be able to run commands prefixed by eb. Some useful ones are:

eb init:
    initializes a project to hold the application in (this should only need to be run once for this project)

eb create pothole-reporting-env:
    creates the pothole-reporting application environment.

eb deploy:
    Updates the pothole-reporting-env application to the files currently found on your machine
    If you are getting the error: ERROR   Your WSGIPath refers to a file that does not exist.
    Then run:
        eb config
           Locate WSGIPath and change to: wheel_time_potholes/wheel_time_potholes/wsgi.py
           Save and close the file, and it will update/redeploy automatically
